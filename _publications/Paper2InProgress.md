abstract: "This paper studies the causal relationship between the risk perception of COVID-19 and consumption expenditure changes in the U.S. at the early stages of the pandemic. Although providing empirical evidence of the causal relationship between risk perception and spending is challenging due to possible endogeneity problems, I address this problem using a two-stage instrumental variable (IV) approach. Specifically, I use the weekly growth rate of COVID-19 cases in New York as a source of exogenous variation in consumer risk perception of COVID-19 in California. Two datasets are used for this purpose: (i) The University of Southern California (USC) Center for Economic and Social Research's Understanding Coronavirus in America Survey and (ii) The Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker. I focus on the period from April 1, 2020 to January 2, 2021, before the COVID-19 vaccine was publicly available in California. The results show that the growth rate of confirmed cases in New York is a strong instrument that has a positive and statistically significant effect on California residents' risk perception of death, infection, money loss, and job loss due to COVID-19. Moreover, I find a statistically significant causal relationship between risk perception and consumption expenditures. This effect is negative for major consumption categories, such as accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, and sporting goods and hobbies. On the other hand, the effect is positive for grocery and food stores and arts, entertainment, and recreation. "
