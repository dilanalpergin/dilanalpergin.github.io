title: "Optimal Health Expenditures under Uncertainty in Patient Numbers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/RiskPerception
abstract: "
Healthcare providers face unexpected changes in patient numbers as diseases and injuries are unpredictable. This paper studies socially optimal health expenditures and treatments by drawing attention to this quantity uncertainty in healthcare markets. This paper is the first to approach this problem from the norms of welfare economics. I first introduce a model that characterizes the socially optimal setting, then provide a model for healthcare providers and compare the outcomes from the two models. The results show that healthcare providers' investments in treatment resources differ from socially optimal levels. Based on this finding, I argue that healthcare providers fail to bring socially optimal treatment to society when there are unexpected surges in hospital patient flows."
