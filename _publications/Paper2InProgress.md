abstract: "How societies deal with healthcare problems requires studying the socially optimal treatment and health expenditures. Healthcare providers face unexpected surges in patient numbers as diseases and injuries are unpredictable. The existence of this uncertainty in healthcare markets has important consequences on societies. Thus, it needs to be studied thoroughly. In this paper, I provide a model for a stylized society in which there is an illness that brings different numbers of ill individuals to the society. Due to this quantity uncertainty, the society has to make some decisions in advance, and others after learning the number of patients. There are many real-world examples showing that societies under uncertainty make decisions in this way. For example, the recent Covid-19 outbreak has put a lot of pressure on individuals, governments, and healthcare providers all around the world. This required the governments and healthcare providers to make many short-term decisions to deal with the unexpected increase in patient demand. For example, the healthcare providers made short-term alterations to patient areas to accommodate caring for an increased number of patients. They increased the number of short-term travel nurses to fill the staff gaps. In other words, the recent Covid-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the existence and importance of uncertainty in healthcare markets. Therefore, I believe that it is important to analyze how societies under uncertainty optimally cope with healthcare problems. To this end, this paper addresses this issue from the norms of welfare economics by studying the socially optimal treatment and health expenditures."
