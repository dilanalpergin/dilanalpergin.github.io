abstract: "This paper studies the role of risk perception in explaining consumption expenditure changes during the COVID-19 pandemic and the mechanism behind such a relationship. Under the framework of the two-stage instrumental variable (IV) analysis, I identify a causal relationship between consumer risk perception and spending by focusing on the period between April 1, 2020 to January 2, 2021, before the vaccine was publicly available in California. Specifically, I use the weekly growth rate of COVID-19 cases in New York as a source of exogenous variation in consumer risk perception in California. Two datasets are used for this purpose: (i) The University of Southern California (USC) Center for Economic and Social Research's Understanding Coronavirus in America Survey and (ii) The Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker. The results show that the growth rate of confirmed cases in New York is a strong instrument that has a positive and statistically significant effect on California residents' risk perception of death, infection, money loss, and job loss due to COVID-19. Moreover, I find a statistically significant causal relationship between risk perception and consumption expenditures. This effect is negative for major consumption categories, such as accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, and sporting goods and hobbies. On the other hand, the effect is positive for grocery and food stores and arts, entertainment, and recreation. "
