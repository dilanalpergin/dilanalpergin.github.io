I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/). My research interests span the two fields of health economics and health policy and applied microeconomics with a focus on consumer behavior. 

My job market paper focuses on the role of risk perception in explaining changes in individual spending in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic and the mechanism behind such a relationship. Another part of my research focuses on the socially optimal treatment and health expenditures under uncertainties.

I am an instructor for Managerial Economics and I will graduate with my Ph.D. in May 2023. I am currently on the job market and I am available for interviews, including at the ASSA 2023 Annual Meeting on January 6-8, 2023.
